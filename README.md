# supervised-machine-learning-challenge

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.

You will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, you will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

### Retrieve the data

In the `Generator` folder in `Resources`, there is a [GenerateData.ipynb](/Resources/Generator/GenerateData.ipynb) notebook that will download data from LendingClub and output two CSVs: 

* `2019loans.csv`
* `2020Q1loans.csv`

We will be using an entire year's worth of data (2019) to predict the credit risk of loans from the first quarter of the next year (2020).

Note: these two CSVs have been undersampled to give an even number of high risk and low risk loans. In the original dataset, only 2.2% of loans are categorized as high risk.

## Preprocessing: Convert categorical data to numeric

Create a training set from the 2019 loans using `pd.get_dummies()` to convert the categorical data to numeric columns. Similarly, create a testing set from the 2020 loans, also using `pd.get_dummies()`. 


## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model

Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier.

## Revisit the Preprocessing: Scale the data

Use `StandardScaler` to scale the training and testing sets. Make a prediction on how the models will change when the data is scaled. Fit and score the LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier models on the scaled data. How do the model scores compare to each other, and to the previous results on unscaled data? How does this compare to your prediction?
